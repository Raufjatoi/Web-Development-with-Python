# now less see some lists , list are just mutable dtable in some sqaure brackets 

l = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4]

# lezz change them since they are mutable we use index to represent numbers thats like [0, 1,2,3 ... -1]

#like 
#print(l[0])
#print(f"last number is {l[-1]}")

# lists can be anything like [ string , float , int ]
l2 = ['string' , 0.1 , 100]
print(l2)

# lezz change the value of float to 10.10
l2[1] = 10.10
print(l2)
